## What problem does this solve?

In a Zero Trust environment, you assume an attacker is already inside your network. The question is not *if* they got in — it is *how far can they go?* ZeroTrustAuditor answers that question by reading the configuration of your Active Directory, your servers, and your network, then flagging every misconfiguration that would let an attacker move laterally, escalate privileges, or reach a Domain Controller.

Think of it as a thorough checklist that never forgets a question. It tells you what is wrong, how dangerous it is, which MITRE ATT&CK technique it maps to, and exactly how to fix it.

**What it is NOT:**
- It does not exploit vulnerabilities
- It does not capture credentials
- It does not make any changes to the environment
- It does not require Domain Admin rights

Every check is equivalent to reading configuration data that a standard domain user already has access to.

## How it works — the audit flow

```
You run the exe
      │
      ▼
Reads audit-config.json
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Five checks run in PARALLEL             │
│                                                      │
│  AdAuditor  ProtocolProbe  LateralPath  Share  Seg  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
      │
      ▼
All findings collected → Deduplicated → Scored
      │
      ▼
Correlation rules applied (dangerous combos get boosted)
      │
      ▼
Reports written: JSON · HTML · CSV · Splunk · Sentinel · CEF
```

**Step by step:**

1. **You provide a host list and domain name.** Either comma-separated on the command line or a plain text file with one hostname per line.
2. **Five audit checks launch simultaneously.** Each is an independent C# class running as a parallel async task. They do not wait for each other — all five run at the same time.
3. **Each check queries its target using read-only .NET APIs.** No scripts are written to disk. No commands are executed on target hosts.
4. **All findings flow into the aggregator.** Duplicates are removed. Risk scores are assigned. Correlation rules boost scores for dangerous combinations.
5. **Reports are written** in all configured formats for humans, machines, and SIEM platforms.

## The five audit modules

### 1. AdAuditor — Active Directory misconfigurations

Uses `System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher` (LDAP) and `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement`. Requires only a standard Domain User account.

| Check | What it finds | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `KERBEROASTABLE_SPN` | Accounts with Service Principal Names — any domain user can request their password hash and crack it offline | High / Critical |
| `ASREP_ROASTABLE` | Accounts that skip Kerberos pre-auth — anyone can request their hash without a password | High / Critical |
| `UNCONSTRAINED_DELEGATION` | Accounts that can impersonate any user — one compromise = full domain access | Critical |
| `DCSYNC_ACE` | Non-DC accounts with replication rights — can pull every password hash from the DC without touching it | Critical |
| `STALE_PRIVILEGED_ACCOUNT` | Admin accounts unused for 90+ days — attackers love dormant accounts, no one notices when they log in | High |
| `NESTED_GROUP_DA` | Groups nested inside Domain Admins — grants admin rights to everyone in that group, often broader than intended | High |
| `MISSING_PROTECTED_USERS` | Privileged accounts not in Protected Users — can still authenticate with weaker NTLM | Medium |
| `ADMINCOUNT_ORPHAN` | Accounts with AdminCount=1 no longer in privileged groups — broken permission inheritance hides delegated access | Medium |

> **Analogy for new technicians:** These are the skeleton keys in your environment. A Kerberoastable SPN account with AdminCount=1 is a single crackable password away from domain admin — the kind of silent misconfiguration that goes undetected for years.

---

### 2. ProtocolProbe — Insecure protocol configurations

Uses `Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey.OpenRemoteBaseKey()` to read remote registry values and `System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient` for port checks. No PowerShell. No WMI.

| Check | What it finds | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `SMB_SIGNING_DISABLED` | Without SMB signing, an attacker on the same network can intercept and relay authentication — logging in as you without knowing your password | High / Critical |
| `NTLM_V1_ENABLED` | NTLMv1 hashes crack with rainbow tables in seconds. LmCompatibilityLevel below 3 means the host accepts them | High / Critical |
| `RDP_NLA_DISABLED` | Without Network Level Authentication, the Windows login screen loads before credentials are checked — exposed to bruteforce tools | High |
| `WINRM_UNENCRYPTED` | WinRM over HTTP (port 5985) without encryption — every command and credential is readable on the wire | High |
| `DCOM_DEFAULT_LAUNCH_PERMISSION` | Absent DCOM permissions default to allowing Everyone to launch COM objects — a known lateral movement path | High |
| `SSH_PASSWORD_AUTH_ENABLED` | Password auth over SSH allows credential stuffing — certificate-based auth is the Zero Trust standard | Medium |

> **Requirement:** The Remote Registry Windows service must be running on target hosts for registry-based checks. Deploy via GPO: `Computer Configuration → Windows Settings → System Services → Remote Registry → Automatic`

---

### 3. LateralPathAnalyzer — Lateral movement paths

Uses `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement` to enumerate local security groups on each target and maps which accounts can reach which hosts.

| Check | What it finds | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `LOCAL_ADMIN_OVERLAP` | Same account has local admin rights on multiple hosts — one compromise enables movement to all of them | Medium → Critical |
| `DOMAIN_GROUP_LOCAL_ADMIN` | Domain group in local Administrators — every member gets local admin, often far more accounts than intended | High |
| `LAPS_NOT_DEPLOYED` | Without LAPS, all machines built from the same image share the same local Administrator password | High |
| `BROAD_RDP_ACCESS` | Large domain groups in Remote Desktop Users — many accounts can RDP directly to servers, bypassing jump server controls | Medium |

> **The lateral movement picture:** This module answers: *"If an attacker compromises one host, which other hosts can they immediately reach without needing additional credentials?"* `LOCAL_ADMIN_OVERLAP` is often the highest-impact finding — one account with local admin on 20 servers turns one breach into twenty.

---

### 4. ShareAuditor — Over-permissive file shares

Uses `System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetAccessControl()` and `System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule` to read NTFS ACLs via UNC path. No SMB enumeration cmdlets needed.

| Check | What it finds | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `SYSVOL_WRITE_PERMISSION` | SYSVOL holds Group Policy scripts that run on every domain computer — write access = code execution on every machine | Critical |
| `ADMIN_SHARE_OVERPERMISSIVE` | C$ or ADMIN$ accessible beyond Administrators — direct lateral movement path | Critical |
| `OPEN_SMB_SHARE_WRITE` | Any domain user can write to this share — attackers plant DLLs, replace binaries, or drop ransomware payloads | High |
| `OPEN_SMB_SHARE_READ` | Any domain user can read this share — sensitive data accessible without special permissions | Medium |

---

### 5. SegmentationChecker — Network segmentation gaps

Uses `System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient` for port probing and remote registry reads for firewall and logging configuration. Verifies that your network segmentation actually prevents lateral movement.

| Check | What it finds | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `CROSS_SEGMENT_ADMIN_PORT` | SMB (445), WMI (135), or WinRM (5985) reachable across network segment boundaries — firewall is not blocking lateral movement protocols | High |
| `WINDOWS_FIREWALL_DISABLED` | Host-based firewall is off — network segmentation without host firewall relies entirely on perimeter controls | High |
| `WEF_NOT_CONFIGURED` | Windows Event Forwarding not set up — attackers know that clearing local logs destroys forensic evidence | Medium |
| `SECURITY_LOG_TOO_SMALL` | Security event log too small — rotates quickly under brute-force load, overwriting evidence of the attack | Low |
| `FIREWALL_LOGGING_DISABLED` | Firewall drop logging disabled — lateral movement attempts and port scans are invisible to the SOC | Medium |

---

## How findings are scored

Every finding gets a base risk score from its severity:

| Severity | Base Score | Meaning | Recommended SLA |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | 9.0 | Direct path to domain compromise | 24–48 hours |
| **High** | 7.0 | Significant misconfiguration enabling targeted attack | 7 days |
| **Medium** | 5.0 | Defense-in-depth gap; exploitable in combination | 30 days |
| **Low** | 3.0 | Best-practice deviation | 90 days |
| **Informational** | 1.0 | Connectivity note or manual review item | Review only |

### Correlation rules — when two misconfigs are worse together

When two dangerous misconfigurations appear on the **same host**, both scores get a +2.0 boost because the combination forms a complete attack chain:

```
SMB_SIGNING_DISABLED (7.0)  +  LOCAL_ADMIN_OVERLAP (7.0)
           │                              │
           └──────── same host ───────────┘
                         │
                         ▼
           Both scores → 9.0 (effectively Critical)

WHY: An attacker intercepts SMB auth → relays it to any host
     where the account has local admin → instant mass lateral movement.
```

**All six correlation rules:**

| Rule | Check A | Check B | Why dangerous together |
|---|---|---|---|
| SMB relay + admin spread | `SMB_SIGNING_DISABLED` | `LOCAL_ADMIN_OVERLAP` | One relayed auth = access to every host the account admins |
| NTLMv1 + admin spread | `NTLM_V1_ENABLED` | `LOCAL_ADMIN_OVERLAP` | NTLMv1 cracks in seconds; shared admin = mass compromise |
| Delegation + Kerberoasting | `UNCONSTRAINED_DELEGATION` | `KERBEROASTABLE_SPN` | Crack the SPN → present ticket to delegating host → impersonate anyone |
| DCSync + stale account | `DCSYNC_ACE` | `STALE_PRIVILEGED_ACCOUNT` | Dormant account with replication rights — low detection, maximum blast radius |
| Unencrypted WinRM + admin spread | `WINRM_UNENCRYPTED` | `LOCAL_ADMIN_OVERLAP` | Credentials on the wire + shared admin password = immediate mass access |
| RDP NLA disabled + open share | `RDP_NLA_DISABLED` | `OPEN_SMB_SHARE_WRITE` | Pre-auth bruteforce + writable share = remote exec + persistence |

---

## What a finding looks like

Each finding in the HTML report and JSON output contains:

```json
{
  "Id": "a3f2c1d8",
  "Host": "SRV01.corp.local",
  "Module": "ProtocolProbe",
  "CheckName": "SMB_SIGNING_DISABLED",
  "Severity": "High",
  "RiskScore": 9.0,
  "Description": "SMB signing is not required on 'SRV01'. SMB relay attacks are possible, enabling code execution without credentials. (Boosted: co-located with LOCAL_ADMIN_OVERLAP)",
  "Evidence": "RequireSecuritySignature=0; EnableSecuritySignature=0",
  "RemediationGuidance": "Set RequireSecuritySignature=1 via GPO: Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies -> Security Options -> Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always).",
  "Tags": { "correlationRule": "SMB relay + admin spread" },
  "DiscoveredAt": "2025-05-11T03:15:22Z"
}
```

| Field | What it means |
|---|---|
| `Host` | The machine where this was found |
| `CheckName` | The specific misconfiguration detected |
| `Severity` | Base risk level (Critical / High / Medium / Low / Informational) |
| `RiskScore` | 0–10 score — above base severity means a correlation boost fired |
| `Evidence` | The raw registry value, ACL entry, or configuration that triggered the finding |
| `RemediationGuidance` | Exact GPO path or command to fix the issue |
| `Tags.correlationRule` | Which correlation rule boosted this finding and why |

---

## Permissions required

The tool is designed to run as a **regular domain user**. No Domain Admin, no local admin, no elevated privileges for most checks.

| Module | What it needs | If missing |
|---|---|---|
| AdAuditor | Domain User (read-only LDAP) | Check skips with logged message |
| ProtocolProbe | Remote Registry service running on targets | Registry reads return null — no finding emitted |
| LateralPathAnalyzer | AccountManagement API access (port 445) | HOST_UNREACHABLE Informational finding |
| ShareAuditor | Network read to UNC paths (`\\host\share`) | Share silently skipped |
| SegmentationChecker | Network connectivity (TCP SYN only) | Port reported as closed |

> **Best practice:** Create a dedicated read-only service account (e.g. `CORP\svc-auditor`) and run the tool under that account. Never run as Domain Admin — it produces false negatives on checks like local admin group membership.

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 1809+ or Server 2019+ (domain-joined or with network access to target domain)
- .NET 8 SDK — download from [dot.net/8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) (**SDK**, not Runtime)
- Domain User account
- Remote Registry service running on target hosts (for registry-based checks)

| `--skip-modules A,B` | Skip specific modules: `AdAuditor`, `ProtocolProbe`, `LateralPathAnalyzer`, `ShareAuditor`, `SegmentationChecker` |

---

## Output formats

All formats are written to the `--output` directory with a timestamp in the filename.

| Format | File | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| HTML | `audit-TIMESTAMP.html` | Human-readable report — open in any browser |
| JSON | `audit-TIMESTAMP.json` | Machine-readable, API ingest, custom tooling |
| CSV | `audit-TIMESTAMP.csv` | Ticket creation in ServiceNow / Jira |
| Splunk HEC | `audit-TIMESTAMP.splunk.json` | Push to Splunk HTTP Event Collector |
| Sentinel | `audit-TIMESTAMP.sentinel.json` | Ingest to Microsoft Sentinel Log Analytics |
| CEF | `audit-TIMESTAMP.cef` | Syslog forwarding to ArcSight, QRadar, or any CEF collector |

Enable additional formats in `audit-config.json`:

```json
"output": {
  "formats": ["json", "html", "csv", "splunk", "sentinel", "cef"]
}
```

---

## Reading the HTML report

1. **Open the file in any browser** — it is fully self-contained, no internet required.
2. **Check the severity dashboard first** — if Critical is non-zero, go straight to those findings before anything else.
3. **Findings are ordered by risk score**, highest first. Findings with a score above their base severity (e.g. a High sitting at 9.0 instead of 7.0) had a correlation rule fire — these represent complete attack chains and should be treated as Critical.
4. **Group by CheckName before remediating.** If `SMB_SIGNING_DISABLED` appears on 30 hosts, that is a Group Policy problem — one GPO change fixes all 30. Fixing them one by one wastes time and misses new hosts.

---

## MITRE ATT&CK coverage

Every finding maps to a specific MITRE ATT&CK technique:

| Tactic | Techniques covered |
|---|---|
| Credential Access | T1558.003 (Kerberoasting), T1558.004 (AS-REP Roasting), T1558.001 (Delegation abuse), T1003.006 (DCSync), T1557.001 (NTLM relay), T1110 (Brute force) |
| Lateral Movement | T1021.001 (RDP), T1021.002 (SMB/Admin shares), T1021.003 (DCOM), T1021.006 (WinRM) |
| Persistence | T1484.001 (GPO modification via SYSVOL write) |
| Privilege Escalation | T1078.002 (Valid domain accounts — stale, nested, orphaned) |
| Defense Evasion | T1562.001 (Disable tools — Sysmon), T1562.004 (Disable firewall), T1562.006 (Indicator blocking — WEF, log size) |

---

## Configuration reference

`audit-config.json` controls all thresholds, exclusions, output formats, and correlation rules. The tool ships with sensible defaults — only customize what you need.

```jsonc
{
  "audit": {
    "staleAccountThresholdDays": 90,       // Flag accounts inactive longer than this
    "maxHostsPerRun": 500,                 // Safety cap — prevents accidental full-domain scans
    "parallelModuleTimeout": 300,          // Seconds before a module is cancelled
    "skipModules": [],                     // Permanently skip modules: ["AdAuditor"]
    "excludeHosts": [],                    // Always skip these hosts: ["honeypot01"]
    "excludeChecks": []                    // Suppress specific findings: ["SSH_CONFIG_UNREADABLE"]
  },
  "thresholds": {
    "privilegedGroups": [
      "Domain Admins", "Enterprise Admins", "Schema Admins"
      // Add your org's custom groups here: "Tier0-Admins", "PAW-Users"
    ],
    "lmCompatibilityLevelMinimum": 3       // Flag hosts below this NTLMv1 threshold
  },
  "output": {
    "formats": ["json", "html", "csv"]    // Add "splunk", "sentinel", "cef" as needed
  }
}
```

**Why pure C#?** The first version of this tool used a C# orchestrator that spawned PowerShell 5.1 child processes. This caused three categories of persistent failures: `CimCmdlets` incompatible with PS Core runspaces, UTF-8 encoding errors in PS 5.1, and parser bugs with long string lines. v2.0 replaces every PS call with a native .NET API — the same information, zero compatibility issues.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| AD checks produce 0 findings | Domain unreachable or no LDAP access | Run `nltest /dsgetdc:corp.local` from the audit workstation |
| Registry checks return nothing | Remote Registry service not running on target | Enable via GPO or: `Start-Service RemoteRegistry` on target |
| LateralPath shows all HOST_UNREACHABLE | Port 445 blocked or no network path to target | Test: `Test-NetConnection SRV01 -Port 445` |
| Hosts file not working | File not found at the path you specified | The tool prints the resolved path — check the output |
| 0 findings despite known misconfigs | Access denied is silent — check completes but reads nothing | Verify Remote Registry is running; test with a host you control |
| Antivirus quarantines the exe | Self-contained .NET exes are sometimes flagged | Add Defender exclusion or sign with your org's code-signing certificate |
| Build error: CS0234 DirectoryServices | NuGet restore did not download the package | Run `dotnet restore` with internet access, then rebuild |
